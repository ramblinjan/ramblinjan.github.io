Primary Audience:
Engineers/engineering leads who are building a team

# Key Takeaway
Your hiring process will match your team whether you like it or not.
So this is partially about the way I think a software engineering team should work.
Namely: moving fast, testing, and communicating.

## Point 1
Move fast.

### Detail 1a
Candidate Rot
Communicate promptly

### Detail 1b
Fail early
Free disposal--don't be afraid of missing someone good and saving time

### Detail 1c
Involve the right people
Empower your engineers to hire--managers don't do code reviews
Recruiters are for saving time ONLY. They are incapable of representing your team's interest.

## Point 2
TDH - Test-driven hiring

### Detail 2a
Know what you're testing for before you write anything / define the expected value

### Detail 2b
Define the expectation and test the actual, not the theoretical

### Detail 2c
Remember Boundary Conditions
- Stress
- Process experience

## Point 3
Don't replace communication with documentation

### Detail 3a
Communicate beforehand, not when it's too late

### Detail 3b
Checklists and templates are necessary BUT NOT SUFFICIENT

### Detail 3c
Pair, then trust
