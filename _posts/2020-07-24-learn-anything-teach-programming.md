_This post is based on a talk I gave at Little Rock Tech Fest, LibertyJS, and at a couple meetups. I'm passionate about helping teams become better at mentorship, teaching, and growth. If you'd like me to give this talk to your team for free, please send me an email at [jan@ramblinjan.com](mailto:jan@ramblinjan.com?subject=Learn%20Anything%20and%20Teach%20JavaScript)_
