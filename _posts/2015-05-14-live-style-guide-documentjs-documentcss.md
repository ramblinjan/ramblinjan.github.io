### [Read the original blog post here.](http://blog.bitovi.com/live-style-guide-documentjs-documentcss/)

When I was at [Bitovi](bitovi.com), I worked on a static site generator/documentation engine called [DocumentJS](documentjs.com). Our designers wanted to be able to use it to document CSS and generate live style guides. Even though the resulting work was just a feature of DocumentJS, I created a separate project site called [DocumentCSS](documentcss.com) to communicate that feature set to the design audience who didn't care about the core JavaScript-oriented project.
