I'm Jan. I'm a Southern boy, a dog-lover, and a serial hobbyist.

I exist to serve by enabling excellence.
I'm passionate about building relationships and process, and believe that
the two *must* be built together. Without process, passion can blind
people to results. 
With process alone, people lose motivation and energy--at most you'll end
up with adequacy. I believe the phrases "time management" and
"work-life balances" are misleading at best and pernicious at worst.
I'm values-oriented and have been known to ask really hard questions
in a job interview or even on a first date.
